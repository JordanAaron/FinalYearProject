# Online 2D Fighting Game
For my final project, Iâ€™m making an online 2D fighting game. The idea behind this decision was to create a new way of playing for this genre of games. I want to implement competitive characteristics into my 2D fighting experience through alternative game modes. I will first focus on the core functional aspects of my game before working on design preferences and the additional features that will make my game unique. The aspects I have prioritized are the Sprites, Maps, Online Connectivity and GUI.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
To run my project you will need Java SE 8 (Java 1.8) or later.
